Do you wonder what would be the way to perform better in class and on exams? Cooperative learning is a well establish technique for enhancing learning. Students often understand what other students misunderstand better than teachers for one thing, and the act of teaching itself becomes a learning experience. Students can express opinions in moderated forums as they develop critical thinking skills and an understanding of the value or hearing multiple perspectives.
<br> </br>
Is social interaction important for education? Social interaction is essential for education. "It helps students learn, retain, and apply" (Stephen Elliot). The more you interact with people, the more you learn.
<br> </br>
What is the purpose of creating this kind of website? We came up with an idea creating this kind site where high school students could interact with other students around the world and they could apply the "become teacher" technique by explaining the material in your own words to other students, as if you are the teacher. Exchanges that proceed from student without a teacher serving as the mediator can be extremely valuable, as a student hash out points of disagreement; the student hears multiple perspective more constructively than they would during the traditional, teacher-driven lecture. Discussing the material will point where you are confused and will help you gather more information. You can do this in learninglobally.com where you can study, interact, and share your thoughts with other students.</h>
